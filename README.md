# Computer Infrastructure

This repository contains my work for the Computer Infrastructure module, part of the Science in Computing (Data Analytics) course at [Atlantic Technological University (ATU)](https://www.atu.ie/).

## Module Overview

The Computer Infrastructure module covers:

- Using and configuring command-line / shell environments  
- Manipulating data, files, and code via the command line  
- Understanding software infrastructures, architectures, and tools  
- Evaluating and selecting infrastructure components for computational tasks 

The course materials, lectures, and assessments are maintained in the lecturer’s repository:  
[Computer Infrastructure (Ian McLoughlin)](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/computer-infrastructure).

## About This Repository



## Tools & Libraries Used

To complete these tasks, I used the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: The programming language used for all tasks. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A web-based environment for running Python code. Learn more [here](https://jupyter.org/).  
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis. Documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).

## How to Run the Code  

All problems for this module are completed inside a single Jupyter Notebook called **`problems.ipynb`**. 

To open and run it: 

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elainecazetta/computer_infrastructure.git
   cd computer_infrastructure
   ```  
2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
If you’re using GitHub Codespaces, simply open problems.ipynb from the file explorer.
Or, if you’re running locally, start Jupyter Notebook with:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
Then open problems.ipynb from the Jupyter dashboard.

3. **Run the notebook cells**
Run the notebook cells in order to see the outputs for each problem.
Each problem is clearly labeled (e.g., Problem 1, Problem 2, etc.) within the notebook.
